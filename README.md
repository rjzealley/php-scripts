# php-scripts
A set of PHP scripts as a PD exercise

1. Write a PHP function to reverse a string in-place or without using additional data.
2. Find the Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ...,1n, find the missing number.
3. FizzBuzz: Print numbers from 1 to n, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with “Buzz,” and multiples of both with “FizzBuzz."![image](https://github.com/rjzealley/php-scripts/assets/12252274/4cfbf522-2e85-4fb9-8422-35a64b921f08)
