A set of PHP scripts as a PD exercise

2. Find the Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ...,1n, find the missing number.
3. FizzBuzz: Print numbers from 1 to n, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with “Buzz,” and multiples of both with “FizzBuzz."
4. Palindrome Check: Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).
